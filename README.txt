This project will aim to discover if there is any difference in the impact of
weather related events before the COVID pandemic and during.

The delay statistics are pulled from:

I have chosen October 19 and October 20 as these are the most recent months
with data that have significant weather impacts during them, each having one
or more significant named winter storms, and significant poor weather. The
weather data comes from the U.K. Met Office.
